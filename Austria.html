  <img src="images/Austria/Therme Experience.jpg">
  <div class="day">
    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 1: Therme Experience</h1>
    <p>Let’s officially kick off this Austria road trip. We recommend spending your first whole day at a Therme, aka an Austrian spa. You’re on vacation after all. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Experience a Therme</h1>
    <p>A Therme is a <span>thermal spa complex</span> that houses thermal pools, various saunas, resting and silent rooms, and a cafeteria. They typically offer massage, spa, and wellness treatments as well. But unlike spa complexes in other parts of the world, you don’t need to have a treatment in order to access all the pools and saunas.</p>
    <p>Typically, the price structure is broken down into a 3-hour pass, all-day pass, or an evening pass. Sauna access is an extra charge. </p>
    <p>The sauna complex in a Therme is an adults-only area. For hygienic purposes, saunas in Austria are always textile-free. That means bathing suits are strictly prohibited in the sauna. Get ready to take it all off and rock your birthday suit. In most saunas, genders are integrated. It’s not creepy, I promise!</p>
    <p>If you <span>stay the night at a Therme spa hotel</span>, access to the thermal spa and sauna area is included. Hotel guests usually have access to exclusive spaces as well. You’ll be supplied with slippers, bathrobes, and towels. </p>
    <p>It’s one of the most relaxing things you can do. So, if you need some time to get over your jet lag, or just want to integrate wellness and relaxation into your trip (in a super authentic way), this is it. Remember to bring your Kindle.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Stay in a Thermal Spa Hotel</h1>
    <p>Choose one of these Thermen, and book an overnight. </p>
    <h7 class="head_3">Therme Linsberg Asia in Lower Austria</h7>
    <p>Therme Linsberg Asia combines great lighting with impeccable design. Because it’s adults-only, the pool and sauna areas flow together seamlessly. </p>
    <h7 class="head_3">Rogner Bad Blumau in Styria</h7>
    <p>The Rogner Bad Blumau Hotel and thermal complex, designed by Friedensreich Hundertwasser. Need I say more? If you love art and want to bathe and steam in basically a huge Huntertwasser installation, stay here. You can read about our experience in our Rogner Bad Blumau Hotel Review.</p>
    <h7 class="head_3">St Martins Therme & Lodge in Burgenland</h7>
    <p>St Martins Therme & Lodge is a blissfully tranquil thermal spa hotel with an “Austrian Safari” theme. The whole complex is surrounded by water. I spent my birthday here and have never felt more relaxed. Staying overnight in St. Martins is a treat. However, it’s a bit out of the way. The other two Thermen above are almost directly on the route.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

<div class="day_main">
  <img src="images/Austria/Riegersburg and Gamlitz.jpg">
  <div class="day">
    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 2: Riegersburg and Gamlitz, South Styria</h1>
    <p>After a relaxing day/night at the Therme, your Austria road trip continues south to Südsteiermark (South Styria), Austria’s unofficial culinary and wine capital.</p>
    <p>While you’ll certainly find great food everywhere in Austria, South Styria combines respect for tradition with a spirit of innovation. Food is (dare I say) more interesting and creative here. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Visit Riegersburg</h1>
    <p>On your way down, you can visit Riegersburg, a picturesque medieval castle enthroned on top of a mighty volcanic rock. The castle and town of Riegersburg are located in the Styrian region of Vulkanland, which is also a wine-growing region. </p>
    <p>For great views of the castle and the surrounding wine country, visit a local wine tavern (Buschenschank). We recommend visiting Wippel for wine, food, and great views, or Buschenschank Bernhart for wine and Jause (meat and cheese platters). </p>
    <hr>

    <h1 class="head_2">Gamlitz, South Styria</h1>
    <p>Continue driving to Gamlitz, the heart of South Styria. We recommend using Gamlitz as your base for exploring this region for several reasons. First, it’s central. Second, you can take advantage of the free Gamlitz Taxi Service, which will usher you between your accommodation and the wine tavern (Buschenschank), winery (Weingut), or restaurant (Wirtshaus) of your choice. </p>
    <p>Your hotel will call the taxi for you and make any necessary reservations (at least ours did – Jaglhof). </p>
    <hr>

    <h1 class="head_2">Eat Dinner in Gamlitz</h1>
    <p>For dinner, you can decide between eating at a Wirtshaus (restaurant), Heuriger (wine tavern), or a Buschenschank (rustic wine tavern). </p>
    <p>One of the loveliest ways to experience Styrian wine culture is in a traditional wine tavern. Buschenschänke are taverns run by winemakers. Some wine taverns are open all year round, while others are only open during certain months. By law, Buschenschänke can only serve cold food and their own wines. A Heuriger, by contrast, can also serve warm food and other wines. </p>
    <p>We ate dinner at Buschenschank Hack – Gebell. We were blown away by the quality and taste of the cheese and meats. We ordered two different Jausen (platters). We used the free Gamlitz taxi to get here. </p>
    <p>If you’re looking for a more formal meal, consider Jaglhof by Domaines Kilger, Wirtshaus Maitz, or Kogel 3. We recommend making a reservation. </p>
    <hr>

    <h1 class="head_2">Stay in Jaglhof by Domaines Kilger in Gamlitz</h1>
    <p>Domaines Kilger is a Styrian winery that operates the restaurant and Jaglhof. Here are 5 reasons to stay here: </p>
    <p>1.Dream Location. The hotel isn’t located in the town center of Gamlitz, but rather on a hill surrounded by vineyards. After a few days of wandering about this region, we can confirm that the views from Jaglhof are simply the finest.</p>
    <p>2.Divine Sunrise and Sunset. The outdoor terrace is perfect for watching the sunset.</p>
    <p>3.Luxurious Mattress and Bedding. </p>
    <p>4.On-site Restaurant (open Thursday – Monday).</p>
    <p></p>5.Private Wine Tasting. Guests can request a private wine tasting of Domaines Kilger and Schiefer wines.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="day">
    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 3: South Styria</h1>
    <p>Day 3 of your Austria itinerary is all about relishing the tastes, smells, and sites of South Styria. We wrote this wine tasting guide to South Styria where we explain how wines are classified in this region, which wineries to visit, tips for wine tasting, and more. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">South Styrian Wine Road</h1>
    <P>You can spend the day driving the South Styrian Wine Road, which starts in Ehrenhausen and ends in Leutschach. There are many (too many to name) wineries located along the route. </P>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Wine Tasting in Kitzeck im Sausal</h1>
    <p>You can also head to Kitzeck im Sausal and visit Weingut and Buschenschank Schauer (winery and wine tavern) Genusshof Kilger (wine tavern),  Weingut Kodolitsch (winery), and Kogel 3 (restaurant).</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Stay a Second Night in Gamlitz</h1>
    <p>Stay another night at Jaglhof by Domaines Kilger in Gamlitz.</p>

<div class="day_main">
  <img src="images/Austria/Graz and Filzmoos.jpg">
  <div class="day">
    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 4: Graz and Filzmoos</h1>
    <p>Your Austria road trip continues to Graz, the charming capital of Styria, and then northeast to Filzmoos. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Visit Graz, Capital of Styria</h1>
    <p><span>Driving Time: </span>45 min <br>  <span>Total Kilometers: </span>49 km </p>
    <p>Graz is actually Austria’s second-largest city, though it feels more like a town. The Styrian capital impresses immediately with its beautiful architecture and laid-back atmosphere. We recommend eating lunch here and walking around the city’s Old Town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
    <p>The historical center sports splendidly medieval facades as well as visionary modern buildings. From the Old Town, head to Schlossberg (Castle Hill). The uphill walk will take you to the iconic Uhrturm (clock tower), where you’ll have a great view of the city.</p>
    <p>Eat lunch at Der Steier and treat yourself to coffee and cake at Tagescafe Freiblick, a rooftop café located in the Kastner & Öhler department store.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Drive to Filzmoos</h1>
    <p><span>Driving Time: </span>2.5 hours <br> <span>Total Kilometers:</span>187 km <br></p>
    <p>From Graz, drive 2.5 hours to the alpine town of Filzmoos in Salzburg State. Facing the Gosaukamm, which forms part of the Dachstein mountain range, Filzmoos is a lovely base for exploring the magical Northern Limestone Alps. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Stay in Filzmoos</h1>
    <p>Midrange | Hotel Bergglück is a traditional Austria bed and breakfast, owned by the same family for over 250 years. With its affordable price point and friendly hosts, you can’t go wrong if you stay here.</p>
    <p>Luxury | meiZeit Lodge is a new hotel in Filzmoos that is quickly becoming the best base in the area for skiing as well as hiking. Guests praise the caring staff, the sunny terrace, the Fit & Well facilities (Finnish pine sauna, BIO herbal sauna, Infrared relaxation loungers, relaxation zone, and Vital drink bar), the generous and varied breakfast buffet, and the overall charm. A bonus of staying here is the complimentary afternoon pie and cake selection served daily between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm.</p>

    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 5: Filzmoos and the Dachstein Mountains</h1>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Hike to Alm Pasture Huts in the Dachstein Mountains</h1>
    <p>What makes Salzburg a particularly delightful hiking destination is the region’s Alm culture. An Alm is a high alpine pasture where livestock graze freely in the summer months. To learn more about Almen and alpine transhumance, read The Alps in Summer: 10 Things you Need to Know Before Visiting.</p>
    <p>In fact, Salzburger Land has the highest density of alpine pastures among the Austrian states. During the hiking season, mountain pasture huts (Almhütten) welcome hikers and make for divinely sinful lunch breaks.</p>
    <p>You have a full day to explore Filzmoos. Start your day by driving to Hofalmen. There’s a small toll (5 EUR) to drive to Hofalmen. Here, you’ll find two alpine pasture huts and the trailheads to Hofpürglhütte (mountain hut) and Sulzenalmen (two more alpine pasture huts). </p>
    <p>For the most divine, mouth-watering Kaiserschmarrn you’ll ever have, head directly to Sulzenalmen (1-hour hike). You can easily extend this hike into a full-day adventure. Use our Filzmoos guide for more information. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Side Trip to Ramsau am Dachstein</h1>
    <p>You can also head to Ramsau am Dachstein (15-minute drive), another holiday town facing the Dachstein range for more hiking and walking. We love this scenic 5 huts trail. </p>

    <div>
    <h1 class="head_1">Day 6: Grossglockner High Alpine Road</h1>
    <p>Your Austria road trip dramatically crescendos as you drive the awe-inspiring Grossglockner High Alpine Road (Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) today. The road is typically open from early-mid May until the end of October. </p>
    <p><span>Driving Time: </span> 3:30 hours (Filzmoos to Matrei in Osttirol)<br> <span>Total Kilometers:</span> 182 km</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Drive the Grossglockner High Alpine Road</h1>
    <p>The 48-km Grossglockner High Alpine Road is a paved serpentine road that steers you into the heart of Hohe Tauern National Park and directly to the base of the Grossglockner (3,798 m), Austria’s highest mountain. The alpine road stretches between Fusch an der Großglocknerstraße in Salzburg with Heiligenblut am Großglockner in Carinthia. </p>
    <p>The drive from Filzmoos to Fusch an der Großglocknerstraße is about 1 hour. You’ll pay a 37.50 EUR toll (see pricing table) to access the road. Here’s everything you need to know about driving the Großglockner Hochalpenstraße, including where to stop, hike, and eat. </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Or Stay in Gschlösstal</h1>
    <p>Tomorrow, we recommend hiking the Innergschlöss Glacier Trail. If you want to spend the night at the trailhead, you can stay at Matreier Tauernhaus (where we stayed). </p>
    <p>This traditional Austrian guesthouse is located at the entrance of the Gschlösstal valley. This is where you’ll take the shuttle to the small hamlet of Innergschlöss, in order to start the Glacier Trail. If you decide to stay in Matreier Tauernhaus, you’ll have a pretty stress-free day (plus free parking). </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Drive to Lech am Arlberg in Vorarlberg</h1>
    <p>The fastest way to get to Lech am Arlberg from Mayrhofen is via St. Anton am Arlberg via the A12 (Inntal Autobahn). However, a more scenic route is via the Bschlaber Landesstrasse (L246) and the Hahntennjoch saddle, which cuts through the Lechtal Alps.</p>
    <p>The Bschlaber Landesstrasse connects Inntal valley and the Lechtal valley. </p>

  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">What to Do in Lech am Arlberg</h1>
    <p>Lech am Arlberg is a famous ski resort town. While everyone associates Lech with winter, we think summer is the best time to visit.</p>
    <p>Lech is a particularly enjoyable destination because it’s wedged between the Lechquellen Mountains to the west and the Lechtal Alps to the east. Both ranges are accessible directly from the town via cableways and seasonal buses.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1 class="head_2">Stay 2 Nights in Lech am Arlberg</h1>
    <p>Budget | Lech Hostel is a budget-friendly accommodation in Lech am Arlberg, offering clean and cozy single, double, and triple rooms. Guests have access to a shared kitchen and shared lounge. Bathrooms are shared as well. The room rate is unbeatable. </p>

The breakfast was extraordinary.</p>
    <p>Luxury | Hotel Auenhof is a family-run 4-star hotel, situated along the River Lech, facing Omeshorn. With its dreamy location and extraordinary staff, Hotel Auenhof outshines other Lech accommodations in terms of its hospitality and atmosphere. The highlight of staying here is the gourmet multi-course dinners, which delight with their creative ingredient combinations, flavors, and presentations. Many hotel restaurants strive to be innovative, but none so successfully as Hotel Auenhof. As a guest, you’ll also enjoy the generous, complimentary afternoon snacks and a very nice wellness area. </p>

    <h1 class="head_2">Where to Eat around Lünersee</h1>
    <p>There’s a mountain hut located at the Lünerseebahn top station called Douglashütte. The food is excellent and the service is swift. On the other side of the lake, there’ a small alpine pasture hut called Lünersee Alpe. Their menu is very limited, so if you’re hungry, definitely eat at Douglashütte. And, then grab a mid-walk beer or beverage at the Alm.</p>

    <h1 class="head_2">Stay 2 Nights in Brandnertal</h1>
    <p>We suggest basing yourself in the town of Brand in Brandnertal, or on the high alpine plateau Tschengla, which overlooks Brandnertal</p>
    <p>Budget | Hotel Lün is a top-rated modern alpine hotel in Brand, offering double rooms as well as apartments with fully equipped kitchenettes and dining areas. Highlights of staying here are the spa area, the breakfast buffet, the fresh and cheerful design.</p>
    <p>Midrange | Pension Bergkristall is an apartment-style accommodation in Brand, next to the Dorfbahn Cable Car Station. If you’re planning to base yourself in Brandnertal for a few days, or even a week, you’ll feel very comfortable here. Breakfast is available upon request.</p>
    <p>Luxury | Aktiv-Hotel Sarotla is a stylish and modern hotel with excellent spa facilities, spacious rooms with balconies, and a fabulous hotel restaurant and bar. Guests can participate in guided hiking and cycling tours free of charge.</p>
    <p>Luxury | The 4-star Schillerkopf Alpine Resort is an exceptional place to stay when you’re ready to take a vacation from your vacation. Positioned on the Tschengla Plateau, high above Brandertal, you’ll be treated to mountain and valley views whether you’re in your bedroom, in the dining room, or in the garden. </p>
    <p>Staying in Schillerkopf is also a culinary experience. Each day, guests are pampered with a 4 chapter Gaumenpoesie (“poetry of the palate”) package. In a nutshell that means that your stay includes a bountiful breakfast (7:30 a.m. – 10:30 a.m.), followed by a lunch buffet (12:00 p.m.), followed by a late afternoon dessert buffet (3:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m.), followed by a 6-course dinner accompanied by live music. So, basically, you don’t want to leave. </p>
    <p>The 4 chapter concept pays homage to the literary genius Friedrich Schiller. Like reading a novel, you progress through the day, one culinary chapter at a time. </p>

    <h1 class="head_2">Innsbruck</h1>
    <p>Innsbruck is the capital of Tirol. Framed by the Karwendel Mountains and the Tux Alps, Innsbruck is a stunner. Spend a few hours walking around the Altstadt (Old Town), and you’ll be completely mesmerized. </p>

    <h1 class="head_2">Heading Back to Vienna</h1>
    <p>It’s about a 6-hour drive from Innsbruck to Austria. </p>
    <p>We recommend breaking up your trip in Salzburg City or somewhere in the Salzkammergut Region.</p>
    <p>We didn’t include Salzburg in our itinerary, because we’re not fans. It feels like a bloated tourist bus stop. That’s just our opinion, though. If you’ve always wanted to see Mozart’s birthplace and Sound of Music filming locations, by all means, go.</p>
