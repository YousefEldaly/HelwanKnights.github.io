            Seville is postcard Spain, a city of Flamenco, bullfighting, and extraordinary Moorish architecture. Its oldest neighborhoods are a picturesque mix of white alleyways and ornate buildings, including Europe's largest cathedral. Most impressive of all is the Real Alc√°zar, a royal residence dating all the way back to the late 1300s.

            Bilbao was placed on the map due to just one building -- the iconic Guggenheim. But this port city surrounded by hills has much more to offer. As an industrial city, it is not the prettiest urban destination in the country, but it's a lively place with old alleyways where you can try some of the flourishing Basque cuisine.

            The country's third-largest city has always been known for its street life, lively during the day and night, thanks to a pleasant climate. Today, it's being discovered as a city break destination, thanks to impressive modern architecture by local world-renowned architect Santiago Calatrava. It's a pleasant place to walk around, with most of its sights found within walking distance. Beyond the center are the beaches, and the impressive Ciutat de les Arts complex with its collection of futuristic buildings. For many, best of all is that this is the birthplace of paella.
